		     INDEXED AND EXTENSIBLE FILES

struct inode_disk
  {
    block_sector_t start;               /* First data sector. */
    off_t length;                       /* File size in bytes. */
    unsigned magic;                     /* Magic number. */
    block_sector_t parent;

    block_sector_t direct_index[DIRECT_BLOCKS];
    block_sector_t indirect_index;
    block_sector_t d_indirect_index;
    bool is_directory;
    uint32_t unused[121-DIRECT_BLOCKS];               /* Not used. */

  };





>> A2: What is the maximum size of a file supported by your inode
>> structure?  Show your work.

The maximum size of a file supported by an inode is 8459264 bytes.
I have 10 direct blocks, 1 indirect, and 1 doubly indirect block.
Each direct block supports 512 bytes, the indirect block supports
128*512 bytes, and the doubly indirect block supports 128*128*512
byte.

The three value total to 8459264 bytes per inode.


---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> extend a file at the same time.

My code does not avoid race condition to extend a file.

I did not implement synchronization for inodes.

File reading in my code is unfair.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A6: Is your inode structure a multilevel index?  If so, why did you

>> indirect blocks?  If not, why did you choose an alternative inode
>> structure, and what advantages and disadvantages does your

Yes, I do have a multilevel index. The project said that files will be 
8.5 MB max, so I figured I need at least one doubly indirect block. Following
that I decided to have 10 direct blocks and 1 indirect block. If I had an alternate
structure, maybe if I just had two indirect blocks, there would be more blocks per file
that do not actually store file data. beucase there will be more sectors used as indirect
blocks, but then the max file size would be much bigger.

			    SUBDIRECTORIES

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B2: Describe your code for traversing a user-specified path.  How
>> do traversals of absolute and relative paths differ?

I was not able to successfully implement subdirectories. After parsing the
file paths, if the first char is a "/" I would start the traversal
at the root directory. Else, I would set the start of the traversal at the
current working directory. 

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B4: How do you prevent races on directory entries?  For example,

			     BUFFER CACHE

			   SURVEY QUESTIONS

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.
